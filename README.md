# Exploratory Data Analysis on Dining Culture in Toronto, Ontario

## Background 
Toronto is renowned for its excellent culinary diversity. As a food enthusiast, I'd love to dive deeper into the local dining culture and explore characteristics of restaurants in Toronto with statistical and geospatial analysis.

What are the most popular categories of restaurants?
What are the highest rated cuisines?
Where are the most expensive restaurants?
Which city ward has the most restaurants?
I will be using data collected from Yelp API and an online dataset to answer the above questions.
